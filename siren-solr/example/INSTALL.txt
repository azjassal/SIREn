SIREn 0.2.3-SNAPSHOT Solr Demo - Install Instructions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is testing version of Solr 3.5.0 with SIREn.

We provide a solr configuration example which use SIREn for indexing and 
searching RDF data. The search interface is using the n-triples query language.
In addition to RDF data indexing and searching, we provide an example for
indexing and querying tabular data such as csv files. The search interface is
an extension of the n-triples query language called tabular.

Basic steps:
  0) Install Tomcat 6
  1) Stop tomcat
  2) Clean previously installed siren
  3) Configure Solr/Siren webapp
  4) Copying context file
  5) Copying SIREn libs
  6) Change file permissions
  7) Start tomcat
  8) Execute demo.sh

0. Install Tomcat 6
(NB: on Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install tomcat6)

1. STOP TOMCAT

- stop your tomcat instance before performing the following steps. 

> /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop

2. CLEAN PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED SIREN

In order to avoid unexpected conflict with previously deployed Solr webapp,  
remove siren webapp directory
> rm -rf $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/siren

3. CONFIGURE SOLR/SIREN WEBAPP

Edit siren.xml to set the path of the war file and SORL_HOME correctly using 
/your/local/path/siren-solr/example/solr as SOLR_HOME:

4. COPYING CONTEXT FILE

Copy siren.xml to:
$CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost/siren.xml
(NB: you may need to create that folder)

5. COPYING SIREN LIBS

Build SIREn and copy siren-core-0.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar, 
siren-qparser-0.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar and siren-solr-0.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar in 
SOLR_HOME/lib.

6. CHANGE FILE PERMISSIONS

- ensure that tomcat has full file permissions on SOLR_HOME:

> chown -R tomcat6:tomcat6 $SOLR_HOME

7. START TOMCAT

- start tomcat

> /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start

- you should be able to access the Solr admin page at 
  http://localhost:8080/siren/
  
- if problems see $CATALINA_BASE/logs/catalina.out

8. EXECUTE DEMO.SH

There are three examples which use SIREn:
- IndexAndQueryNTriple.java
This example shows how to index and query three artificial documents. Two kinds
of queries are used, keyword and n-triple query.
- IndexAndQueryTabular.java
This example shows how to index and query a csv formated file. Each line will
become a document of the index. This example uses the tabular query syntax for
searching these documents.
- IndexAndQueryNtripleAndTabular.java
This example shows how to load ntriple and tabular data into an indexed document.
It shows how to mix tabular and ntriple queries.

We provide a script, demo.sh, which will compile the java examples, load the
documents and execute some queries. To run execute it, type:

> bash demo.sh

You will see written on the standard output the queries executed and the documents
they matched.

If you go to the statistic page [1] of the Solr admin interface, you should see
the counter 'numDocs' equals to 3 (the last demo loaded 3 documents).

You can also execute queries using the Solr admin interface [2]. Replace 'standard'
in the field "Query Type" by 'siren' to activate the SIREn query parser.
The Solr admin interface allows only keyword queries. In order to run a ntriple
query, you need to add the parameter "&nq" in the address bar of your browser. For
tabular queries, you need to use the parameter "&tq".
